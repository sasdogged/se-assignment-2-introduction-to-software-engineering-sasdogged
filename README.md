Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software Engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with design, development,testing and maintenance of software applications.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Software engineering is the systematic approach to deigning,developing,testing and maintaining software but a programmer's primary role is to write computer code,probably also test codes, update codes and create script. 


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
(1)Planning: "What do we want?" Project planning is a vital role in the software delivery lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software.
(2)Requirements gathering and analysis: The second step of SDLC is gathering maximum information from the client requirements for the product. Discuss each detail & specification of the product with customer,the main goal of this stage is that everyone understands even the minute detail of the requirement.
(3)Design: In the design phase, the architectural and detailed design of the system is created. The program developer then scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end user.
(4)Coding or Implementation: Time to code! It means the translating the design to a computer legible language, in this fourth stage of SDLC, the tasks are divided into modules or units and assigned to various developers.This stage is considered to be one of the longest in SDLC,the developers need certain predefined coding guidelines and programming tools.
(5)Testing: Once the developers build the software, then it is deployed in the testing environment, the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system.
(6)Deployment: Once the testing is done and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use. The size of the project determines the complexity of the deployment,the users are then provided with the provided with the training or documentation that will help them to operate the software.
(7)Maintenance: The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those needs to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is the seventh phase of the SDLC where the developed product is taken care of.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: Agile is flexible and adaptable to change, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and to incorporate new ideas and feedback as they arise. While on the other hand Waterfall is rigid and inflexible,does not allow for a change once a phase is completed. 
When deciding between Agile and Waterfall,it is important to consider the specific needs of the project and the team's experience and preference. Agile is well suited for projects that are uncertain or have changing requirements as it allows for flexibility and adaptability and also for projects that require close collaboration and frequent feedback as it promotes teamwork and communication. Waterfall on the other hand is well suited for projects that have well defined requirements as it allows for detailed planning and control. It is also well suited for projects that have a clear end goal and a defined timeline.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: Requirement engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis,specification and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors and aligns expectations.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing software into separate, independent modules, each responsible for a distinct feature or functionality. 
Maintainability:Changes in one module typically do not affect the others, making bugs easier to fix and track down without risking other parts of the system.
Scalability:Modular systems can be scaled more readily by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones without impacting the rest of the system.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
(i)Unit testing: Is the practice of creating small, quick running tests for individual software components to verify code functionality and compliance with safety and security standards.
(ii)Integration testing:Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules,it focuses on determining the correctness of the interface.
(iii)System testing evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.
(iv) Acceptance testing is a method of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability.The major aim of the test is to evaluate the compliance of the system with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery or not.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:Version control systems is a system that record changes made to a file or set of files. 
With version control systems, developes are able to:(i)Maintain a consistent codebase(ii)Collaborate(iii)Keep records and (iv)Reverse Errors.
Some version control systems:
(i)Git --Open source,collaboration,pull requests etc
(ii)Azure devops server -- Access controls/permissions, application management,bug tracking and so many others


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: The role of a software project manager include communicating with clients,leading the team,planning, serving as a liaison and also testing and ensuring results.
Key responsibilities include:(i)Project estimation (ii)Scheduling (iii)Staffing (iv)Risk Management. While some challenges faced might include:(i)Lack of accountability (ii)Resource allocation (iii)Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.The different types of software maintenance are:
(i)Corrective maintenance is undertaken to fix software errors like poor database design,bugs, viruses, security vulnerabilities, etc. However it should not be confused with problem solving;Because the goal is to fix the errors and not to design new solutions.
(ii)Adaptive software maintenance -- Tech teams perform adaptive maintenance to adapt their existing software to changing business needs and development environments.
(iii)Preventive software maintenance -- Preventive software maintenance keeps our software functioning efficiently in the long run. It focuses on reducing the deterioration risk of your software and improve it's scalability and reliability in the future.
(iv)Perfective software maintenance --- The goal of perfective maintenance is to enhance the overall performance and usability of the software.
The primary goal of software maintenance is to modify and update software applications after deployments to fix bugs and improve system performance, this process takes once the software is developed or deployed.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
(i)Data privacy
(ii)Accessibility
(iii)Addictive design
(iv)Algorithmic bias
(v)Software Security
